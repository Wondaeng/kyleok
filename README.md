# Greetings, ðŸ‘‹

## Undergraduate Research Intern at GUGC, Center for Biosystems and Biotech Data Science

I'm actively engaged in cutting-edge projects at the intersection of AI and biotech. Here's a glimpse of my recent work in 2024:

- **MuSe2024 Challenge**  
  Advancing multimodal social perception analysis (repository in progress)
  
- [Thesis: AI Interpretability in Medical Imaging](https://github.com/ugent-korea/attention_maps/)  
  Exploring the potential of attention maps to address the interpretability crisis in AI-assisted medical imaging

- **AI Summer School (AISS) 2024**  
  Serving as a mentor to nurture the next generation of AI enthusiasts (repository in progress)
